# Student Performance Predictor: Forecasting Academic Success Based on Study Hours

## Project Overview:-
This project aims to predict the academic performance of students based on the number of hours they dedicate to studying. By leveraging data analytics and machine learning, specifically linear regression, we strive to provide an accurate forecast of student grades, helping educators and students alike understand the impact of study habits on academic success.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):-
Conducted an in-depth exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and relationships within the dataset.
Used area plot, ggplot, and pair plot.

## Data visualization to identify trends and patterns.
Data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure quality and accuracy.

## Model Development:-
Utilized a linear regression model to predict student grades based on study hours.

## Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Training the linear regression model on the training set.
Evaluating the model's performance on the testing set.

##Model Evaluation:-
The model achieved a high R² score of 0.98, indicating that it explains 98% of the variance in student grades based on study hours. Performance metrics were assessed to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## Conclusion:- 
The high R² score demonstrates the effectiveness of the linear regression model in predicting student performance based on study hours. This tool can be instrumental for educators in identifying students who may need additional support and for students in planning their study schedules to maximize their academic potential.
